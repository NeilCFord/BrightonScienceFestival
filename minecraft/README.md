A lot of the code featured here is based off the work of Martin O'Hanlon at [Stuff About Code](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/). Please visit his site and his [Github repository](https://github.com/martinohanlon) for many more awesome examples.

**clear.py** - clear a space 25 blocks in all directions from the player's position, replacing the floor with stone.

**trapped.py** - trap the player by surrounding him with the same kind of block as he is standing on.

**free.py** - free the player from the above trap by replacing one wall with air.
